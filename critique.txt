The hardest part of this exercise was that it was simply put, quite boring. A humidifer instruction manual is hard to design for as it is very difficult to image a useful design for one. The card that I designed was very simple, but I really couldnt think of any design elements that would have made sense for it, and also the website was a simple one that gets the point across. Overall, the difficulties came from the plainness of the whole idea itself.
